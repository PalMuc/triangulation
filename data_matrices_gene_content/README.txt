How to find the file you are interested in?


Use the PDF or the relevant supplementary table to decide which matrice you are looking for base on 
the number of species (SP # column) the parameters used (I and E values) and trimming or Ab initio. 
The default parameters dataset have additional hiding table for naming convention in supplementary table 4,
 but can be easily found also by the mentioned above criteria. 
After finding the matrix of interest by criteria look on the column "File name in repository" 
and use it to find the relevant NEXUS format file. For linux: Use $find *Past-Text-in-cell* or go manually.

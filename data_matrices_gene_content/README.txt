**How to find the file you are interested in?** 


Use the PDF or the relevant supplementary table to decide which matrice you are looking for base on the number of species (SP # column) the parameters used (I and E values) and trimming or Ab initio. 
The default parameters dataset matrices have an additional supplementary table for naming convention provided as supplementary table 4, but they can be easily found also by the mentioned above criteria. 
After finding the matrix of interest by name look for the corresponding entry in the column "File name in repository" and use it to find the relevant NEXUS format file. 
For linux: Use $find *Past-Text-in-cell* or go manually.
